# Economic Data Analysis: Inflation, Unemployment, and Interest Rates

## Overview
This project analyzes historical economic indicators including inflation, unemployment rates, and interest rates for selected countries. The data spans several decades and provides insights into how these variables interact over time.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes economic metrics for various countries, sourced from international economic databases. It covers the following key variables:
- Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)
- Unemployment, total (% of total labor force)
- Real interest rate (%)

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The data underwent initial cleaning to handle missing values and format adjustments. The main steps included:
- Loading the dataset and inspecting data types and missing values.
- Filtering data for specific countries of interest, such as New Zealand, Australia, and the United States.
- Selecting relevant columns and setting appropriate index for time series analysis.
- Removing rows with missing data to ensure consistency in visualizations and analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to explore trends and relationships between variables:
- Visualizations include line plots, scatter plots, and box plots to understand trends over time.
- Statistical tests (t-tests) were performed to assess relationships between inflation, unemployment, and interest rates.

## Findings
Key findings from the analysis include:
- Inflation tends to correlate negatively with unemployment, indicating an inverse relationship.
- Interest rates show varied relationships with inflation across different countries, with some correlations observed.
- Significant changes in economic indicators during specific periods (e.g., financial crises) were noted.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of economic indicators and their interrelationships over time. It highlights the dynamics between inflation, unemployment, and interest rates, offering insights that can be valuable for economic policy and financial analysis.
